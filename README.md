# neo4j-graphql.js

A GraphQL to Cypher query execution layer for Neo4j and JavaScript GraphQL implementations.

- [Read the docs](https://grandstack.io/docs/neo4j-graphql-js.html)
- [Read the changelog](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)

_neo4j-graphql-js is in active development. There are rough edges and APIs may change. Please file issues for any bugs that you find or feature requests._

## Installation and usage

Install

```
npm install --save neo4j-graphql-js
```

### Usage

Start with GraphQL type definitions:

```javascript
const typeDefs = `
type Movie {
    title: String
    year: Int
    imdbRating: Float
    genres: [Genre] @relation(name: "IN_GENRE", direction: "OUT")
}
type Genre {
    name: String
    movies: [Movie] @relation(name: "IN_GENRE", direction: "IN")
}
`;
```

Create an executable schema with auto-generated resolvers for Query and Mutation types, ordering, pagination, and support for computed fields defined using the `@cypher` GraphQL schema directive:

```javascript
import { makeAugmentedSchema } from 'neo4j-graphql-js';

const schema = makeAugmentedSchema({ typeDefs });
```

Create a neo4j-javascript-driver instance:

```javascript
import { v1 as neo4j } from 'neo4j-driver';

const driver = neo4j.driver(
  'bolt://localhost:7687',
  neo4j.auth.basic('neo4j', 'letmein')
);
```

Use your favorite JavaScript GraphQL server implementation to serve your GraphQL schema, injecting the Neo4j driver instance into the context so your data can be resolved in Neo4j:

```javascript
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server';

const server = new ApolloServer({ schema, context: { driver } });

server.listen(3003, '0.0.0.0').then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`GraphQL API ready at ${url}`);
});
```

If you don't want auto-generated resolvers, you can also call `neo4jgraphql()` in your GraphQL resolver. Your GraphQL query will be translated to Cypher and the query passed to Neo4j.

```js
import { neo4jgraphql } from 'neo4j-graphql-js';

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    Movie(object, params, ctx, resolveInfo) {
      return neo4jgraphql(object, params, ctx, resolveInfo);
    }
  }
};
```

## Manipulating query generation

### Custom context injection basics

Multiple use-cases arise that might necessitate customizing portions of the Cypher queries generated by `neo4j-graphql-js`. To address this modification of auto-generated queries and mutations, advanced users can define and pass a factory function in the `context` object under the `context.inject` property. One example use-case is implementing fine-grained access control authorization/access control through the business logic layer, rather than through custom directives. To accomplish this using `neo4j-graphql.js`, you can implement the factory like this:

```javascript
import {
  typeIdentifiers,
  safeVar,
  getQueryCypherDirective
} from 'neo4j-graphql-js/dist/utils';

context.inject = {
  parameterFactory: (context, resolveInfo) => {
    const { typeName, variableName } = typeIdentifiers(resolveInfo.returnType);
    const safeVariableName = safeVar(variableName);

    let precedingStatements = [],
      subjectPatternPrefix = '',
      optionalMatchStatements = [],
      whereClauses = [],
      returnClauses = '';

    // if `nodeQuery`, then check for READ access on the node
    if (!isMutation(resolveInfo) && !getQueryCypherDirective(resolveInfo)) {
      precedingStatements = ['MATCH (u:User {id: ${context.user.userID})'];
      whereClauses = [`(u)-[:CAN_READ]->(${safeVariableName})`];
    }

    return {
      precedingStatements,
      subjectPatternPrefix,
      optionalMatchStatements,
      whereClauses,
      returnClauses
    };
  },
  // If additional return clauses are supplied through the parameter factory,
  // the `resultsParser` can process these additional values
  // (and potentially throw useful errors like `AuthorizationError`)
  // before feeding the results to `extractQueryResult()`.
  resultsParser: (results, context, resolveInfo) => {
    return results;
  }
};
```

### Example (as envisioned)

Without defining a parameter factory function, the following GraphQL query:

```
{
  Movie(title: "River Runs Through It, A") {
    title
    year
    imdbRating
    actors {
      name
    }
  }
}
```

translates into:

```
MATCH (movie:Movie {title:"River Runs Through It, A"})
RETURN movie { .title , .year , .imdbRating,
  actors: [(movie)<-[ACTED_IN]-(movie_actors:Actor) | movie_actors { .name }] }
AS movie
SKIP 0
```

With the parameter factory function defined like in the subsection above, it translates into:

```
MATCH (u:User {id: YOURUSERID)
MATCH (movie:Movie {title:"River Runs Through It, A"}) WHERE (u)-[:CAN_READ]->(movie)
RETURN movie { .title , .year , .imdbRating,
  actors: [(movie)<-[ACTED_IN]-(movie_actors:Actor) | movie_actors { .name }] }
AS movie
SKIP 0
```

Alternatively, if the parameter factory function had been defined as follows:

```javascript
context.inject = {
  parameterFactory: (context, resolveInfo) => {
    return {
      precedingStatements: [],
      subjectPatternPrefix: `(u:User {id: ${
        context.user.userID
      })-[:CAN_READ]->`,
      optionalMatchStatements: [],
      whereClauses: [],
      returnClauses: ''
    };
  }
};
```

It would have been translated into:

```
MATCH (u:User {id: YOURUSERID)-[:CAN_READ]->(movie:Movie {title:"River Runs Through It, A"})
RETURN movie { .title , .year , .imdbRating,
  actors: [(movie)<-[ACTED_IN]-(movie_actors:Actor) | movie_actors { .name }] }
AS movie
SKIP 0
```

## What is `neo4j-graphql.js`

A package to make it easier to use GraphQL and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) together. `neo4j-graphql.js` translates GraphQL queries to a single [Cypher](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/) query, eliminating the need to write queries in GraphQL resolvers and for batching queries. It also exposes the Cypher query language through GraphQL via the `@cypher` schema directive.

### Goals

- Translate GraphQL queries to Cypher to simplify the process of writing GraphQL resolvers
- Allow for custom logic by overriding of any resolver function
- Work with `graphql-tools`, `graphql-js`, and `apollo-server`
- Support GraphQL servers that need to resolve data from multiple data services/databases
- Expose the power of Cypher through GraphQL via the `@cypher` directive

## Benefits

- Send a single query to the database
- No need to write queries for each resolver
- Exposes the power of the Cypher query language through GraphQL

## Test

We use the `ava` test runner.

```
npm install
npm build
npm test
```

The `npm test` script will run unit tests that check GraphQL -> Cypher translation and the schema augmentation features and can be easily run locally without a test environment. Full integration tests can be found in `/test` and are [run on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js) as part of the CI process.
